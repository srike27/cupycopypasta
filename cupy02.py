"""
In computing, a compute kernel 
is a routine compiled for high throughput accelerators 
(such as graphics processing units (GPUs), 
digital signal processors (DSPs) or 
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)), 
separate from but used by a main program 
(typically running on a central processing unit).

"""
ELEMENTWISE KERNELS
A definition of an elementwise kernel
consists of four parts:
an input argument list,
an output argument list,
a loop body code,
and the kernel name. 
For example, a kernel that computes
a squared difference f(x,y)=(xâˆ’y)^2
is defined as follows:
"""

x = np.random.uniform(0,5,1000000)
x_gpu = cp.asarray(x)
y = np.random.uniform(0,5,1000000)
y_gpu = cp.asarray(y)

    return z
